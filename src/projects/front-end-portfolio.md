This is a website for learinig animations between loading pages.

### What i used to build this website

For this website I used React, CSS, HTML, Framer motion and Next.js.
Framer motions was specially helfull for creating smooth transitions between pages
as well as first loadung animation.

For smaller thig's i user simple CSS3.

In this website i made a landing page, gallery page ant contact page.
Gallery page has two optional galleries. One is a type of slide
and traditional grid style gallery with it's own module when image is clicked.
