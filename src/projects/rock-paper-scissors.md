This is a website to play rock paper scissors online with friends.

### What i used to build this website

For this website I used Meteor, React, JS, CSS, HTML, Framer motion.

It's still project in development. There is much to improve.
But simply said it is one that i'm proud of.
With this project i started to lear Meteor and  Framer motion.

Setup for now is simple. User submit his username and playing room is created with 
one player. After another user log's in he is connected/redirected in to the room where's only one player.
If room has 2 players they can start playing.

Future plan is to make waiting room to see connected players and to call to play
users from that list. Button to quit the game, so that players would know that oponnet
has left the game.
