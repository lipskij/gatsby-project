This is the same site that you're visiting now.

### What i used to build this website

It was made by using Gatsby, graphql queries and simple CSS3.
First time working with gatsby so nothing impressive like page transition animations
or hover effects.
Made simple favorite anime list using API from https://api.jikan.moe.
And async await functions.
Anime page is not configured for gatsby-plugin-image. It uses it's own media queries.
But other are.
